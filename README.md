# CitiBike-Feed-Parser
Citi Bike Feed Parser Drupal Custom Module

Vagrant Drupal Development
--------------------------

Vagrant Drupal Development (VDD) is fully configured and ready to use
development environment built with VirtualBox, Vagrant, Linux and Chef Solo
provisioner.

The main goal of the project is to provide easy to use, fully functional, highly
customizable and extendable Linux based environment for Drupal development.

Full VDD documentation can be found on drupal.org:
https://drupal.org/node/2008758


Getting Started
---------------

VDD uses Chef Solo provisioner. It means that your environment is built from
the source code.

  1. Install VirtualBox
     https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

  2. Install Vagrant
     http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

  3. Prepare VDD source code
     Download and unpack VDD source code and place it inside your home
     directory.

  4. Adjust configuration (optional)
     You can edit config.json file to adjust your settings.
     By default Drupal 8 and Drupal 7 sites are configured.

  6. Build your environment
     Please double check your config.json file after editing. VDD can't start
     with invalid configuration. We recommend to use JSON validator.
     This one is great: http://jsonlint.com/

     To build your environment execute next command inside your VDD copy:
     $ vagrant up

     Vagrant will start to build your environment. You'll see green status
     messages while Chef is configuring the system.

  7. Visit 192.168.44.44 address
     If you didn't change default IP address in config.json file you'll see
     VDD's main page. Main page has links to configured sites, development tools
     and list of frequently asked questions.

Now you have ready to use virtual development server. By default 2 sites
are configured: Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. You can add new ones in config.json file anytime.


Basic Usage
-----------

Inside your VDD copy's directory you can find 'data' directory. This directory
is visible (synchronized) to your virtual machine, so you can edit your project
locally with your favorite editor. VDD will never delete data from data directory,
but you should backup it.

Vagrant's basic commands (should be executed inside VDD directory):

  * $ vagrant up
    Start virtual machine.

  * $ vagrant provision
    Configure virtual machine after source code change.

  * $ vagrant reload
    Reload virtual machine. Useful when you need to change network or
    synced folders settings.

  * $ vagrant ssh
    SSH into virtual machine.

  * $ vagrant halt
    Halt virtual machine.

  * $ vagrant destroy
    Destroy your virtual machine. Source code and content of data directory will
    remain unchangeable. VirtualBox machine instance will be destroyed only. You
    can build your machine again with 'vagrant up' command. The command is
    useful if you want to save disk space.


Citi Bike Feed Parser Custom Module
-----------------------------------

in sortable table. The module is in: /sites/all/modules/custom/citi_bike

  * After setting up the Vagrant Drupal Development and getting the Drupal 8 site running
  * Enable the Citi Bike Module (citi_bike)
  * Go to the homepage or drupal8.dev/citibike/stations and voil√†!
